# Real-Time-Construction-Optimization
Implementation of a scenario that mimics the real time construction optimizations.
### Problem Statement: 
At a construction site of some building there are varieties of workers working to accomplish a task. There are fixed 
number of laborers, fixed number of masons. The priority of mason task is more than the priority of the laborers tasks. 
Implement a scenario that mimics the real time construction optimizations.  Here you have two task queues with 
different priorities and fixed number of worker threads. Implement the thread pool pattern programming style for the 
construction program.
